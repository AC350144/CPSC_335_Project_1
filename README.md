# Project 1
This project solves two real-world problems using algorithms that detect patterns in data given.

# Description for Algorithm 1, Wildlife Monitoring System
In this wildlife monitoring problem, we are recording the number of movements an animal makes and finding whether or not there is a loop based on their movements which is inputted by the user as coordinates into the system.

# Description for Algorithm 2, Greedy Approach to Hamiltonian Problem
We use the greedy approach to solve the Hamiltonian problem of which city would be the most optimal to start in when traveling across a set of cities. The algorithms decides the preferred starting city based on the distance between each city, fuel that is available in each city, and the miles per gallon of the car we are using.

# Usage for Algorithm 1
1. Run the wildlife_monitoring.cpp file.
2. Input the number of recorded coordinates in the terminal.
3. Input the pairs of coordinates in the format "[(0, 1), (1, 2), ...]" in the terminal.
4. The cpp file will then output whether there is a loop detected or not based on the input provided in steps 2 and 3.

# Usage for Algorithm 2
1. Run the greedy_hamiltonian.cpp file.
2. Input the distances between each city in the format "5 25 15 10 15" in the terminal.
3. Input the fuel available at each city in the format "1 2 1 0 3" in the terminal.
4. Input the number of miles per gallon that the car can travel.
5. The cpp file will then output which is the preferred starting city.
